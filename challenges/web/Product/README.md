## Question Text

Try, try and try, the more I try, the more I cry  
I practice maths with my heart and soul,  
yet I am not able to achieve my goal.  
I never get marks in maths,  
in spite of my great endeavors fate is never in my favor.  
I really want to improve my maths, because I love this subject,  
and for this, I am trying my level best.  
I am candid so I confess, in mathematics examination I always create a mess,  
all the answers I guess, and ultimately the marks I get are quite less.  
I believe that if I do ample practice, I'll one day probably achieve my goal,  
and I seriously have to improve,  
because in our lives maths plays a very significant role.
