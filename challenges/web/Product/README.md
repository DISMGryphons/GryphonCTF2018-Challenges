## Question Text

Try, try and try, 
the more I try, the more I cry  
I practice math with my heart and soul,  
yet I am not able to achieve my goal.    
Despite my great endeavors,
fate is never in my favor.  
"Math is great" - 
is what others would say.
Yet, I hate it and wish it'd go away.
One thing does make me feel better,
Now I can find the area of a feather
