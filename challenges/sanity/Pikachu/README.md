# Pikachu

## Question
Charmanders are red.  
Squirtles are blue.  
If you were a Pokemon,  
I’d choose you.  
Your smile is stronger  
Than a Hyperbeam  
Like Jesse and James,  
We’d make the perfect team.  
I’ll stay by your side  
Like Pikachu and Ash,  
And I’ll love you more than  
A level 100 Rapidash.  
You’re more legendary than a  
Zapandos, Entei, or Mew.  
But out of all the 802…  
I choose you!
