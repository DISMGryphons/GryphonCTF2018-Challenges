## Question Text

I have intercepted this encrypted EMAIL message sent to Lupusregina, see if you can find any useful intel.

### Hints (Optional)
1. What is the first line when you write emails?

## Setup Guide
1. Run `distrib/Lupusregina.py -f generate/plaintext -o distrib/Lupusregina -a 6364136223846793005 -c 12820163 -s 5`

## Solution

```python
# Linear Congruential Generator

'''
p is modulo defined as 0 < p
a is the multiplier defined as 0 < a < p
c is the increment 0 <= c < p ( if c = 0 the LCG is called Multiplicative 
'''
def lcg(seed, a, c, p):
    last = (a * seed + c) % p
    while True:
        yield last
        last = (a * last + c) % p
```

We have a pseudo random number generator (Linear Congruential Generator) which we need to break by finding a and c.

To find a and c we need the first 3 values generated by the lcg which in this case means we need the first 12 bytes.

Since this is an email message we can assume that the plaintext starts with `Dear Lupusregina,` so the first 12 bytes will be `Dear Lupusre` which we can use to xor with the ciphertext to get back the first 3 values generated by the lcg.

We can then use the following formula to find a and c
```python
# states[0] is the first value generated by the lcg, states[1] is the second and so on...
a = (states[2] - states[1]) * gmpy.invert(states[1] - states[0], m) % m
c = (states[1] - a * states[0]) % m
```

With this we can resume the state of the lcg and generate the rest of the key to recover all the plaintext.
